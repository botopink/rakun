A **Spring-style application framework** for botopink — an IoC container with
constructor dependency injection plus a declarative web layer (`#[restController]`
+ route annotations). **Opt-in, never auto-loaded:** it enters a module's scope
only via `from "rakun"`. **The compiler core knows nothing about rakun** — every
behaviour is plain botopink + a host runtime, on the generic annotation-processor
mechanism (`@Decl` reflection, comptime decorator bodies, `@emit`).

How the wiring works: each component decorator (`decorators.bp`) is a comptime fn
over the annotated `type` (`DeclKind.Type` with no `variants` — an enum-shaped `type` is rejected). It `@emit`s, at the application site, (1) a scan
self-registration and (2) a SINGLETON factory `__rkMake_<Type>()` that constructs
the value once (`rkSingleton`) and caches it, injecting each field by its own
factory — except a `#[value("key")]` field, filled from config (`rkProp`/
`rkPropInt`) and kept OFF the DI graph. A controller additionally `@emit`s one
route registration per mapped method (reading `decl.methods` + the `#[route]`
prefix); a `#[configuration]` `@emit`s a `__rkMake_<ReturnType>()` per `#[bean]`
method. botopink has no top-level mutable state, so the registries those calls
feed — the scan list, the singleton cache, the cycle guard, the config props, the
router table — live in `runtime.mjs`, reached through the `#[@External.Node]`
declarations in `runtime.bp`. The emitted code references those runtime fns by
name, so a module declaring components also imports them (`import {service,
rkScan, rkSingleton, rkEnter, rkDone, rkRegisterRoute, …} from "rakun"`). The HTTP
value types + the `Request` behavior are real emitted code (`http.bp`);
`Rakun.run` (`bootstrap.bp`) starts rakun's own node `http` transport
(`rkServe` → `serve` in `runtime.mjs`).

## Tree

The repository is a **workspace** (decision 75 of 1.0.10-beta): the root `botopink.json` declares
members and is never a package — no `src`, `files`, `entry` or `dependencies`; `botopink build/test`
there is the located refusal `botopink.json is a workspace, not a package — run this command inside
one of its members: …`. Every `modules/*/` and `examples/*/` holding a `botopink.json` is a member,
named by its own manifest. The **core is the member `modules/rakun/`**; `from "rakun"` resolves to it.

## Module tree (`root.bp`)

`modules/rakun/src/root.bp` is the explicit module-tree root — the core builds from it, not
a deprecated blind `src/` scan. It declares the four compiled modules
`pub mod decorators; pub mod http; pub mod runtime; pub mod bootstrap;` (all
public surface, reached via `from "rakun"`; the `@emit`ted wiring imports the
runtime fns by name). The declaration module `rakun.d.bp` (the future `Context`
behavior) is **not** in the tree: it is wired through the core's `botopink.json` `files`
(`modules/rakun/botopink.json`), which also lists `root.bp` first — decision 75's rule that a
library member lists every module a consumer may import, or it `ships nothing`.
`.d.bp` modules are not resolved by `mod` paths (the resolver follows only
`<name>.bp` / `<name>/mod.bp`), mirroring how `libs/std` keeps its ambient `.d.bp`
out of `root.bp`. rakun declares **no dependencies**: the HTTP transport
`Rakun.run` starts is `serve` in its own `runtime.mjs` (bound as `rkServe`), so a
consumer declares only `rakun`. (It used to name a `server` library that exists in
no repository — `botopink check` failed with `LibNotFound` before reading rakun's
source.)

The core's `botopink.json` carries both target keys on purpose: `"target": "commonJS"` is
the build target the CLI reads (`config.zig`), and `"targets": ["commonJS"]` is
the per-member whitelist `botopink-lib-test` reads (`lib-test-runner/src/discovery.zig`)
to skip the erlang/beam cells. The workspace's `targets` is `["commonJS", "erlang"]` — the default a
member inherits when it declares none — and a member may only **restrict** it, so the core's
`["commonJS"]` is a restriction and dropping it would widen the core's matrix to a red erlang cell,
not fix a no-op key. Front 04 (the erlang runtime) is what adds `erlang` to the core.

`erlang` stays out of it for a reason that is rakun's, not the compiler's:
every `rk*` host cell in `modules/rakun/src/runtime.bp` carries an `@External.Node` form and
no erlang one, so an erlang run stops at `function rkScan/1 undefined`
(re-measured 2026-09-18 — only `http.bp`'s single test, which touches no host
cell, passes). emilia's and onze's host cells each fit one inline
`@External.Erlang` expression over the process dictionary; rakun's DI graph,
router and HTTP server are 231 lines of `runtime.mjs` that do not. The way out
is a library shipping an `.erl` host module beside its `.mjs` sidecar.

**That is no longer blocked on the CLI.** `libs.shipErlSidecars`
(`compiler-cli/src/cli/libs.zig:564`) is `shipMjsSidecars`' erlang counterpart:
it reads the `atom:atom(` qualifiers out of the emitted erlang and copies the
host `<atom>.erl` a lib keeps in `src/sidecars/` or `src/` into the output. It
is wired into `botopink test` (`test_cmd.zig:194`). What is left is rakun's own
work — writing the 231 lines as an `.erl` module and putting `@External.Erlang`
on the 17 host cells — plus the `build.zig` call site, which is still open and
belongs to the compiler, not here.

## Design at a glance

- **IoC container** — components (`#[component]`/`#[service]`/`#[repository]`/
  `#[controller]`/`#[restController]`) are scanned at module load; each gets an
  emitted **singleton** factory `__rkMake_<Type>()` (`rkSingleton` — one instance
  per type, shared across a 3-level chain / diamond).
- **Constructor injection** — a dependency is declared as a field of the `type` and
  resolved **by type** (the factory calls the field type's own factory).
  Immutable-first: no setter/field injection.
- **`#[value("key")]` property injection** — a `#[value]` field is filled from the
  config source (`rkProp`/`rkPropInt`), **excluded** from the DI graph (the factory
  reads `f.annotations` to detect it). `#[configuration]` + `#[bean]` register a
  `__rkMake_<ReturnType>()` so a bean's return type is injectable by type.
- **Cycle detection** — `__rkMake_X` brackets construction with `rkEnter`/`rkDone`;
  a cycle A→B→A raises at first construction. (A *comptime* cycle diagnostic would
  need a whole-graph view no single decorator has — a recorded follow-up.)
- **Web layer** — `#[restController, route(prefix)]` + `#[getMapping(path)]`/… emit
  a `rkRegisterRoute(verb, prefix + path, handler)`; `rkDispatch`/`rkDispatchHttp`
  match (verb, path) — including `:name` params — and run the handler over a live
  `Request`/`Response`, or 404. `rkRegisterRoute` is generic over the request type
  so the emitted closure's `req` unifies nominally with the handler's `Request`.
- **Bootstrap** — `Rakun.run(App(port: 8080, basePath: "/api"))` (`bootstrap.bp`)
  reads the router back and starts `rkServe` (node `http`), dispatching each live
  request via `rkDispatchHttp`. The runtime `.mjs` files ship next to the emitted modules (G2).

## Conventions

- **`.bp` over `.d.bp`.** Logic lands in real emitted `.bp` (`http.bp` incl. the
  `Request` behavior, `runtime.bp`'s `declare fn`s, `decorators.bp` bodies,
  `bootstrap.bp`). Only the future `Context` behavior stays declaration-only in
  `rakun.d.bp`. `Request.param`/`query`/`header` return a plain `string` (`""` when
  absent), not `?string` — behavior-method optional returns don't yet get the
  `@Option` lowering, and a required path var / empty default is the cleaner contract.
- **Host state behind `#[@External.Node]`.** The one mutable seam is `runtime.mjs`; the
  core never sees it. Decorator bodies obey the comptime constraints (no sibling
  calls, `if`-expr, bare-`if` only last, block-lambdas) — see
  [`../botopink-lang/modules/compiler-core/src/comptime/AGENTS.md`](../botopink-lang/modules/compiler-core/src/comptime/AGENTS.md).
- **Imported, not prelude.** Reached via `from "rakun"` — never auto-loaded into
  the type `Env`, no core embed/registry.
- **Tests live here.** rakun's tests are `test { … }` blocks inside its own
  `.bp` files (run by `botopink test`), NOT in the compiler's Zig test suites.
  Wrong-placement *rejection* is covered generically by the compiler's
  annotation-processor suite (a compile-failure can't be a runtime `assert`).
- Keep this file in sync with `docs.md` and the spec in the same change.

## CI

`.github/workflows/test.yml` runs `zig build test-libs -- --lib rakun
--target <t>` for `{commonJS, erlang, beam}` on `ubuntu-22.04` +
`macos-14`, plus `commonJS` on `windows-2022`. Under the workspace, `--lib rakun`
restricts the runner to the **core member** (the umbrella has no row); without
`--lib` the runner discovers every member of the workspace — one row each,
the scaffolds as compile-only `–` cells and the example as an application. No `wasm` cell —
rakun's server surface targets node + the BEAM. The `erlang` rows keep
`allow_fail: true` (see the `botopink.json` note above for what actually blocks
them). `BOTOPINK_LANG_REF` repo variable pins a specific botopink-lang ref
(default `feat`).

Bootstrap: check out this lib + a fresh `botopink-lang` clone, place
this lib under `botopink-lang/repository/rakun/`, then `zig build
install && zig build test-libs`.

## Tagging (auto)

`.github/workflows/tag.yml` reads `version` from `botopink.json` and
tags every push to `feat`/`master`/`main`:

- **feat** → moving `<version>-feat` tag (force-pushed on every push).
- **master** / **main** → immutable `<version>` tag. Pushing the same
  SHA twice is a no-op; pushing a *different* SHA without bumping
  `version` is a hard error (bump it in `botopink.json` to publish a
  new release).

Set `requires.rakun = "feat"` in a consumer's `botopink.json` and run
`bpmp sync` to preview unreleased work.

## Local gate

`scripts/git-hooks/pre-commit` is the tracked pre-commit gate. It is
self-contained: it sources `scripts/git-hooks/lib/runner-standalone.sh`
from this repository and reaches nothing outside it, so a standalone
clone, a checkout inside the botopink meta workspace and a worktree run
the same gate. Install it once per clone:

```sh
git config core.hooksPath scripts/git-hooks
```

`core.hooksPath` is per clone and applies to every worktree of it. The
gate checks staged files for conflict markers, then — because the root
`botopink.json` is a workspace — runs `botopink test` **inside every
`modules/*/` that holds a `botopink.json`**, each on its own manifest
target (`erl` and `node` on `PATH`); a red member fails the gate and names
the re-run command. (A root manifest without `"workspaces"` keeps the old
single `botopink test` over `src/` + `test/`.) The compiler binary is located via (in order)
`$BOTOPINK_BIN`, the nearest ancestor
`repository/botopink-lang/zig-out/bin/botopink`, then `$PATH`. If none
resolve, the gate prints a yellow warning and exits 0 — CI runs the full
suite and catches any regression there. Never commit with `--no-verify`;
fix the red instead.

After `botopink test`, the gate builds every `examples/*/` that has a
`botopink.json` (`runExamplesGate`, each with its own manifest target,
into a throwaway `--out`); CI runs the same function once per workflow.
`scripts/known-broken-examples.txt` lists the examples allowed to fail —
`examples/<name>  <reason>` per line — and cannot rot: a listed example
that builds, or a listed path that no longer exists, fails the gate too.
When a fix makes an example build, delete its line in the same commit. The list may be absent,
empty or hold only `#` comments — each means no example is allowed to fail.
`examples/rakun` (member `rakun-example`, depending on `rakun` through
`{ "workspace": true }`) builds; nothing is listed. It also **runs**: `botopink run`
inside it serves `GET /api/users/` → `ana, bob, cleo`, `GET /api/users/ana` →
`Hello, ana!`, `GET /api/posts/` → `hello world | rakun rocks`,
`POST /api/posts/` → 201 `created: hi` and `GET /api/nope` → 404, which is what
its `src/main.bp` header documents. Its `main.bp` imports the whole type
closure of each module it uses (`UserController`, `UserService`,
`UserRepository`, `Request`, `Response`, …): importing a type re-checks its
declaration in the importing module, so every type its fields and method
signatures name has to be in scope there too, or the build reds with
`unknown type '<Name>'`.
